Describe a particular struggle that you overcame when working on this programming assignment/what was the most fun aspect of this project - 
A struggle I overcame while working on this programming assignment was the transition between what I already knew to PD curses. At first I was creating all of my borders and designs with cout statements that resulted in lengthy and unnecassary code. It took a lot of tutorials and guides to learn the syntax I should use to make the code use curses. Although it was hard to get used to at first, once I got a hang of it, it become very fun. I was able to use the new syntax to add things I wasn't really sure how to add before. For example, font colors and ascii characters. Well I sort of already knew how to do those things but not in a way that felt right. Now I know it is simpler than I thought and I have many more options to customize the console screen. Moving forward to the juicier stuff, like adding in files and code that actually performs task, I will be able to design around it how I like.
